# Simplified Order Tracking System

This feature implements a customer-friendly order tracking system that uses simplified order IDs instead of full UUIDs, making it easier for customers to look up their orders.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Changes

A new `simplified_id` column has been added to the `orders` table. This column stores a user-friendly order ID format like `ORD-12345678` that is easier for customers to type and remember than a full UUID.

### 2. Migration Process

To implement this change:

1. Run the SQL migration script to add the `simplified_id` column and populate it for existing orders:

```bash
# First, set up your environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit the .env file to include your Supabase credentials:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
# SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key

# Then run the migration
node run_migration.js
```

The migration will:
- Add the `simplified_id` column to the orders table
- Generate simplified IDs for all existing orders
- Create a trigger to automatically generate simplified IDs for new orders
- Create an index for faster lookups

### 3. API Changes

The order verification and order details APIs have been updated to support lookups using either the simplified ID or the full UUID.

### 4. User Interface Improvements

The order tracking form has been redesigned to be more user-friendly:
- Cleaner layout with better spacing
- Intuitive input fields with clear labels
- Search icon for better visual cues
- Input validation and formatting for better error prevention
- Improved error messages

## Testing

After implementing these changes, you should test:

1. Looking up orders using the simplified ID format (ORD-XXXXXXXX)
2. Looking up orders using the full UUID (for backward compatibility)
3. Creating new orders and verifying that simplified IDs are automatically generated
4. Verifying that the order tracking page correctly displays and processes these IDs

## Future Improvements

Consider these future enhancements:
- Include the simplified order ID in order confirmation emails
- Add a QR code to confirmation emails that links directly to the order tracking page
- Create a dedicated tracking link that doesn't require customers to enter any information
